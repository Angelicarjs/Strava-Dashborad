# Strava Dashboard

A personalized interactive dashboard built with **Python Dash** that visualizes Strava activity data in the browser. This web-based dashboard provides insights into workout patterns, performance metrics, and spatial activity distribution through heat maps and geospatial analysis.
This dashboard serves as both a motivational tool and a decision-making support system for fitness enthusiasts and athletes seeking data-driven training insights.

## Data Extraction

The `nicole_strava.csv` file was generated by following the steps in the [Strava API extraction guide](https://github.com/Cloudy17g35/strava-api). Using a personal Strava API client, the workflow involves authenticating with a client ID, client secret, and refresh token, then fetching activity data such as distance, elevation, pace, and timestamps. The data is then processed and saved into `nicole_strava.csv`, which serves as the input for the dashboard visualisations.

## Features

- Interactive activity filtering by type (hike, run, bike/ride) and date ranges
- Activity heat maps for spatial visualisation of frequency and distribution
- Performance analytics tracking workout preferences and speed evolution
- Geospatial analysis with hotspot identification using Getis-Ord statistics

```

**Note:** The current main implementation resides in the `union v1` with `main.ipynb` as the primary executable.

## Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nicolevasos/Strava-Dashboard.git
cd Strava-Dashboard/Union
```

Create and activate the conda environment:
```bash
conda env create -f strava_env.yaml
conda activate strava_analysis
```

## Usage

**Important:** The Jupyter Notebook must be executed to generate the dashboard before visualisation.

1. Run the main notebook to process data and generate the dashboard
2. View the dashboard using one of the following methods:
   - **Notebook output:** View visualisations directly in the Jupyter Notebook canvas
   - **Local server (recommended):** Access the interactive dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:8050/`

The dashboard allows users to filter activities by type and date range, explore spatial patterns through heat maps, and analyse performance trends over time.

## Technical Stack

- **Backend:** Python, Jupyter Notebook
- **API:** Strava API
- **Geospatial Analysis:** GeoPandas, Folium
- **Visualisation:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Dash
- **Statistical Analysis:** Getis-Ord statistics
- **Mapping:** LeafLet, MapBox, Carto
- **Environment:** Conda
